ideas for a trap finding algo in chess with an engine and data

The move does not lose advantage past 0

analyze given fen position for score, and 5 best lines (n depth) -> score (-/+ integer), lines (pgn[5] descending)

filter out moves which will cause the target rep color (white or black) to lose advantage

for each of the remaining best moves, calculate which of the resulting positions is most "forcing" for the opponent. 
Forcing could mean that the move has the lowest number of possible responses for the opponent which allow them to not lose score from the previous evaluation
i.e. one move might be the best engine move, but another move only has 1 proper response, and it's not obvious, so if that move isn't made then we end up with higher advantage than if we had played an engine move

We also have access to FEN based next move probabilities from lichess data. We would want to prioritize lines in which this single reponses possible is shown to be a less probable response in the game history data

At the end of this, we should have a function in python which can take a FEN and then return the most "forcing" move
